# Fighters Knowledge Base

In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, every position, attack, defense, or maneuver can be, at a certain point, cataloged, categorized, and interlinked.

Moreover, a collaborative knowledge base can be created, and patterns like fighting styles or strategies can be used to identify an athlete's favorite moves or enhance a current game with related moves.

## Technical Aspects
- For dynamic querying and to avoid overfetching, GraphQL should be adopted as API interface.
- As data structure, Generic Trees, or groups of Trees called Forests can be adopted. Each node describing a fighting technique can have specific depths, and siblings, and can be linked to other nodes.
- Graph Databases or Triplestore (RDF) Databases can be adopted to retain the data.

## Business Concepts
- Data science and statistics.
- The simple access to the Knowledge Base via API Key can be offered upon paid subscription. By contract, the information shall not be retained or cached for longer than a specific period.
- Packages of presets like training plans and famous fighters analysis can be sold.

## Possibilities to scale
- Knowledge Graph AI or Graph-based AI can offer predictions for fights, or enhancements for fighters looking for improvements or alternatives.
- More than one martial art can be combined.
