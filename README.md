# Rod's Not so Crazy Ideas

In this repository I intend to share my ideas that could become a software solution.

Why would I share these ideas here? Well, mostly becuase it is fun. They can help me to organize or reuse my thoughts, display some creativity, and maybe serve as inspiration for other people who are looking for new ideas for a possible side project. Plus, I am found of the saying "The best way to have a good idea is to have many bad ideas" :).
