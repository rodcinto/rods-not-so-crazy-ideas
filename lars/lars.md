# Live Antagonic Response Service (L.A.R.S.)

This is a funny one.

Across my professional life, I had the chance (or misfortune), to meet some people who'd disagree with you just for the sake of having an argument, regardless of whether your opinion is right or wrong, or even wether they think the same way or not.

The name is obviously fictional. Powered by conversational AI, users can test their patience and argumentation powers in a chat against a very peculiar bot called Lars.

With a petulant and obnouxious personality, Lars will find flaws in your arguments, point out retorical falacies, and use contradictions against you no matter the topic, common sense or not.

To avoid troublesome topics, Lars would refuse to talk about subjects that might cross any legal boundary. Anyways, if you are easilly triggered, you should probably skip this conversation.

Are you ready to beat Lars in a debate?
