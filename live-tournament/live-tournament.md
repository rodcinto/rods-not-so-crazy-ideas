# Live Tournament
This idea combines two services. The first service is the tournament management, providing the administration of participant groups, generation of brackets, scheduling the matches, and so on. On top of that, the second service comes in place, providing streaming over the navigation of the brackets, allowing people to watch in real time the ongoing matches or re-watching the previous matches available in the brackets.

## Business Concepts
- Software sold as a product or service subscription.
- Pro features like multiple streams or multiple devices.
- Advertisements and sponsorship.

## Possibilities to Scale
- Different businesses can be combined. Filming crew, equipments, and infrastructure resources can be rent along with the tournament streaming platform.
