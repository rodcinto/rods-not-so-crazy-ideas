# Trash and Treasure
This idea comes and goes in my head. It was one of the frist inspirations I had when I arrived in Germany and saw how people leave objects, books, furnitures, or even eletronics on the sidewalk as donation for others to talk.

As the name says, "Someone's trash can be someone's treasure". Therefore, Trash and Treasure.

The difference between using TnT and any other e-commerce like Ebay, is that in TnT it is not allowed to sell anything, and the exchanges and safety are responsibility of the users.

## How it can be used
With geolocation, it is possible to find some treasures around while walking your dog or going for a run, or just informing your friends.

Given it can be illegal to dispose things or obstruct the sidewalk, pick-up points can be set.

## Technical Aspects
- Strong community policies must be adopted.
- Profanity, scamming, and anything from same nature must be controlled.

## Business Concepts
- Although trading or money exchange should not take place, donations could. Offers can be "bought" by transfering a symbolic amount to some charity center of user's chice.
